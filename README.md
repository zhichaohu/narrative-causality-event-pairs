## Overview
Telling and understanding stories is a central part of human experience, and many types of human communication involve narrative structures. Theories of narrative posit that narrative causality underlies human understanding of a narrative. Our focus here is the four different relations posited by narrative theories to underly narrative coherence:

* PHYSICAL: Event A physically causes event B to happen
*  MOTIVATIONAL: Event A happens with B as a motivation
* PSYCHOLOGICAL: Event A brings about emotions (expressed in event B)
* ENABLING: Event A creates a state or condition for B to happen. A enables B.

 

## Data
This dataset contains evaluation data used in all experiments for the aforementioned paper:

* Experiment 2, CPC vs. Rel-gram Event Pairs: evaluation questions and results
* Experiment 3, Narrative Causality Types: evaluation questions and results
